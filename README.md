# AmazonWebScraping
A Python web scraper using Selenium &amp; BeautifulSoup to extract laptop data (title, price, link) from Amazon India. It navigates through pages automatically and saves the results in an Excel file with clickable links—ideal for price tracking and product research. Thanks to (Ankush Sharma)[https://github.com/AnkushEngineer] for the original repo
